# j3x' Audit Portfolio 💼

## Summary
I'm an ex-web2 security researcher who turned full-time into web3 since february 2025. I had some experience in web3 before by doing bug bounties, but since the full-time transition I started participating in audit contests, and managed to get some pretty good results.
